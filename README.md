this collection of codes is meant to be a growing library of tools and small apps for reusability. if it can be applied more than once, it's getting thrown in here.

as of 10/23/2024 **lang** code and some other reusable bits have been moved to [verble](https://github.com/odd-get-evened/verble) for **lang**, and some other miscellaneous methods to [oddpy](https://github.com/odds-get-evened/oddpy).
